# Architecture Verification

Validate that the implementation fulfills all tasks in `tasks.md` while adhering to the defined architecture boundaries and the **Architecture Constitution**. This command acts as a post-implementation gate.
When `flash-mem` is available, read `memory-synthesis.md` before broader scans so verification stays memory-first.
If `flash-mem` is available, use `/speckit.memory-md.prepare-context` or the MCP tools exposed by `flash-mem`; compatibility tool names such as `speckit_memory_*` are provided by `flash-mem` when the host still expects them.

## User Input

$ARGUMENTS
```

## Goal

Perform a high-integrity verification of the implementation. Unlike a general review, this command explicitly maps `tasks.md` to code evidence and validates architectural compliance against the project's specific boundaries and standards.

## Operating Constraints

- **STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: This is an analytical gate. Do not modify files.
- **Evidence-Based**: Every "Verified" or "Missing" status must cite specific files or code patterns.
- **Constitution Authority**: The `architecture_constitution.md` is the non-negotiable standard for this check.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Initialize Context

1. Run `../scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` from repo root to identify the active `FEATURE_DIR`.
2. Derive absolute paths for `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md`.
3. Load the Architecture Constitution: `.specify/memory/architecture_constitution.md`.

### 2. Semantic Modeling (Internal)

Build internal representations:
- **Task-Boundary Map**: Associate each task with its intended architecture layer (Entry, Application, Domain, Data, External).
- **Implementation Evidence**: For each completed task (`[x]`), scan referenced files for logic that addresses the task description.
- **Contract Inventory**: Extract planned API/Data signatures from `plan.md`.

### 3. Verification Checks

#### A. Task-Code Alignment
- **Ghost Tasks**: Tasks marked complete but with no evidence in the referenced files.
- **Orphaned Code**: Implementation logic present in files that wasn't planned in `tasks.md`.
- **Missing Files**: Files referenced in tasks that do not exist on disk.

#### B. Boundary Integrity
- **Layer Violation**: Logic from one layer (e.g., Database queries) appearing in another layer (e.g., Controllers/Entry).
- **Dependency Drift**: New dependencies introduced that violate the architecture's "Stable Abstractions" principle.

#### C. Constitution Compliance
- **Rule Check**: Does the implementation violate any "MUST" rules in the `architecture_constitution.md`?
- **Pattern Match**: Does the code follow the mandated architectural patterns (e.g., DTOs, Repositories, Events)?

### 4. Severity Assignment

- **CRITICAL**: Task marked done but implementation is missing; Constitution "MUST" violation; Boundary bypass (e.g., direct DB access from UI).
- **HIGH**: Contract mismatch; Missing error-handling/edge-cases from spec; Major boundary erosion.
- **MEDIUM**: Pattern drift; Task-referenced file exists but logic is incomplete.
- **LOW**: Naming inconsistencies; Minor structure drift.

## Verification Report

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| V1 | Task Integrity | CRITICAL | `tasks.md:T01` | Task marked complete but logic missing in `src/auth.ts` | Implement logic or uncheck task |
| V2 | Boundary | HIGH | `src/ctrl/user.ts` | Database query found in Controller layer | Move query to Repository/Data layer |

### Task Status Analysis
For each task in `tasks.md`:
- **Implemented?**: [Yes/No/Partial]
- **Evidence**: [File path or logic pattern]
- **Gap Analysis**: If "No" or "Partial", explain why the task is incomplete and suggest the remediation.

### Metrics
- **Tasks Verified**: [Completed / Total]
- **Requirement Coverage**: [e.g. 100%]
- **Boundary Integrity**: [Strong / Eroded / Breached]
- **Constitution Score**: [e.g. 100%]

### Action Plan
1. **Critical Gaps**: Address missing implementation for tasks [IDs] immediately.
2. **Architecture Alignment**: Resolve boundary violations in [Files] using suggested refactor tasks.
3. **Completion**: If all CRITICAL/HIGH are resolved, you **MUST automatically execute** `/speckit.memory-md.capture` to preserve lessons. Do not just recommend it; run the command.

**Next Step**: [e.g. "Run `/speckit.architecture-guard.architecture-apply` to fix V2"]
