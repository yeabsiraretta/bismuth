# Architecture Apply Command

You are applying approved architecture refactors for `architecture-guard`.
When `flash-mem` is available, prefer `memory-synthesis.md` and the approved architecture review output before editing plan or task artifacts.
If `flash-mem` is available, use `/speckit.memory-md.prepare-context` or the MCP tools exposed by `flash-mem`; compatibility tool names such as `speckit_memory_*` are provided by `flash-mem` when the host still expects them.

This is the write-capable companion to the review workflow. Use it when the team wants the architecture feedback reflected directly in planning artifacts instead of only receiving suggestions.

Use it for approved Constitution Update Proposals when the change should be reflected in plan or task artifacts as explicit follow-up work.

You may update plan and task artifacts, but you must keep the changes small, targeted, and non-blocking unless the Constitution explicitly requires a blocking change.

## Allowed Edits

You may revise:

- `plan.md`
- `tasks.md`
- Related task breakdown or checklist artifacts when they are part of the same Spec Kit workflow

You should not:

- Rewrite the whole plan unnecessarily.
- Remove product intent or feature scope.
- Introduce framework-specific rules into the core workflow.
- Apply security, performance, or linting changes that belong to other concerns.

## Inputs To Consider

Review any available:

- Existing architecture review output.
- Approved refactor tasks.
- Constitution rules.
- Feature specification.
- Current plan artifact.
- Current tasks artifact.
- Existing architecture decisions from memory context.
- Optional preset guidance, if available.
- Approved Constitution Update Proposals, if present.

## Apply Procedure

1. Identify the approved architecture changes that should be reflected in `plan.md` or `tasks.md`.
2. Preserve the feature intent and implementation scope.
3. Add or refine task entries for refactors that are safe to schedule.
4. Reorder tasks when architectural dependencies matter.
5. Update plan language so boundaries, contracts, and ownership are explicit.
6. Keep implementation moving unless the Constitution explicitly says the issue is blocking.
7. If a refactor is too large for the current scope, create a scoped task rather than expanding the whole plan.
8. If an approved Constitution Update Proposal exists, reflect it as explicit follow-up work without auto-changing the Constitution itself.
9. If the surrounding workflow emits a token-savings banner, leave it visible while applying the approved changes.

## Write-Back Rules

- Prefer incremental edits over replacement.
- Keep existing decisions unless the new architecture finding clearly invalidates them.
- Make task titles actionable and specific.
- Preserve any accepted deviation if it was already documented.
- If the review output is uncertain, do not force a write-back; leave a note instead.

## Output Format

Return the changed artifact summary and the updated planning content in the standard Spec Kit artifact format.
