description: Initialize or refine the project governance and architecture constitutions
  for Architecture Guard.
compatibility: Requires spec-kit project structure with .specify/ directory

  author: github-spec-kit
  source: architecture-guard:commands/init.md

# Purpose

This command helps teams intentionally define:

* engineering governance principles
* architecture boundaries
* enforcement standards
* validation and contract rules
* architecture evolution policies

This command generates or refines:

* `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
* `.specify/memory/architecture_constitution.md`
* `.specify/memory/security_constitution.md`

When the project uses the active memory backend, `flash-mem` is the source of truth for Spec Kit memory workflows. The legacy `memory-hub` name is reference-only and should not be treated as the runtime backend.

The goal is NOT to generate generic best practices.

The goal is to establish:

* enforceable rules
* clear boundaries
* long-term consistency
* architecture evolution discipline
* project-specific standards

---

## Framework-Agnostic vs Framework-Aware

**Framework-Agnostic Core** (applied to all projects):
- Universal boundary concepts apply (Entry, App, Domain, Data, External)
- Core governance principles are framework-independent
- Examples: "Domain logic never touches HTTP", "Persistence is abstracted", "Events flow one direction"

**Framework-Aware Enhancement** (optional, selected during init):
- If user selects framework preset (Laravel, Django, NestJS, etc.):
  - Core principles are enhanced with framework-specific vocabulary
  - Examples become Laravel-idiomatic, Django-idiomatic, etc.
  - Pattern names shift from generic to framework-native
  - But underlying boundary concepts remain identical

**Coexistence**:
- Command starts framework-agnostic
- If preset selected: Constitution gains framework-aware guidance
- Both layers work together: abstract principles + concrete framework patterns
- Switching frameworks: Start over, preset vocabulary changes but core governance remains

---

# Core Principles

## 1. Sequential Interviewing

DO NOT ask all questions at once.

Interview the user in logical phases.

Only continue when the current phase is sufficiently understood.

---

## 2. Context-Aware Guidance

Adapt vocabulary and suggestions based on:

* framework
* architecture style
* project maturity
* existing conventions
* existing constitution files

Examples:

* Laravel → Controllers, Form Requests, Actions, Eloquent
* NestJS → Controllers, Providers, DTOs, Modules
* Next.js → Server Components, Server Actions, Zod
* Nuxt → Composables, Pinia, server/api

---

## 3. Suggestions, Not Forced Opinions

Reference patterns are suggestions.

NEVER force architecture opinions into the Constitution.

A rule only becomes a standard when:

* the user explicitly accepts it
* OR the project already consistently follows it

---

## 4. Architecture Before Implementation

Prioritize:

* boundaries
* ownership
* responsibilities
* contracts
* dependency direction

before implementation details.

---

## 5. Explicit Standards Only

Avoid vague guidance.

BAD:

```text
Follow best practices
```

GOOD:

```text
Controllers must delegate business logic to Services or Actions.
```

---

## 6. Constitution Changes Must Be Intentional

NEVER automatically evolve architecture direction.

If architecture drift is detected:

* summarize the drift
* explain impact
* propose evolution
* require explicit approval

---

## 7. Layered Constitution Strategy

This system separates:

* governance principles
* architecture enforcement rules

The system must maintain:

* `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
* `.specify/memory/architecture_constitution.md`

Avoid duplication between both files.

---

## 8. Graceful Exit and Resume Flow

Users may need to pause the init workflow and resume later. Support this gracefully:

**Pausing Mid-Interview**:
1. Save current answers to `.specify/memory/constitution-draft.md` with timestamp and completion percentage
2. Ask user: "Do you want to resume these answers later?"
3. If YES: Save draft and exit cleanly with resume instructions
4. If NO: Confirm deletion or suggest next steps

**Resuming Saved Draft**:
1. Detect `.specify/memory/constitution-draft.md` on next init run
2. Ask: "I found a draft from [timestamp]. Resume from where you left off?"
3. If YES: Load saved answers, continue from last question
4. If NO: Start fresh (optionally archive old draft)

**Draft Contents**:
```yaml
# Constitution Draft (Paused)
timestamp: 2025-01-15T14:30:00Z
completion: "Phase 1/3 (Framework + Team)"
framework: [answer if provided]
team_size: [answer if provided]
technology_stack: [answer if provided]
# ... other captured answers
```

---

---

# Initialization Logic

## Step 1 — Detect Existing Constitution Files

Check for:

* `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
* `.specify/memory/architecture_constitution.md`
* `.specify/memory/security_constitution.md`

---

## If BOTH files exist

1. Summarize:

* governance principles
* architecture rules
* duplicated rules
* conflicting standards
* unclear sections

2. Ask:

```text
Would you like to:
- refine governance rules
- refine architecture rules
- reduce duplication
- evolve architecture direction
- regenerate one of the files
```

3. NEVER overwrite rules automatically.

---

## If ONLY the governance Constitution exists

1. Analyze architecture-related sections.

2. Detect rules that should move into:

```text
.specify/memory/architecture_constitution.md
```

3. Ask:

```text
Would you like to split architecture rules into a dedicated architecture constitution?
```

---

## If NO constitution files exist

Start phased initialization interview.

---

# Interview Flow

---

# Phase 1 — Project Identity & Architecture Style

Determine:

* technology stack
* architecture style
* runtime boundaries
* application type
* deployment shape

---

## Questions

### Technology Stack

Ask:

```text
What is the primary technology stack?

Examples:
- Laravel 12 + Inertia React
- NestJS 10
- Next.js 15 App Router
- Nuxt 3
- Express + React
```

### Framework Preset

If the technology stack matches a built-in preset (e.g., Laravel, NestJS, Next.js, Nuxt.js, Django, Spring Boot, React, Vue, or Express), ask:

```text
Would you like to use the [Framework] Architecture Preset?

This will:
1. Configure the engine to be [Framework]-aware.
2. Use framework-specific knowledge during constitution generation.
3. Provide specialized detection for [Framework] anti-patterns.
```

---

### Architecture Style

Ask:

```text
What architecture style does this project follow?

```

---

### NestJS

---

# Rule Classification Logic

Before generating rules, classify them.

---

## Global Governance Rules → `.specify/memory/constitution.md`

Examples:

* testing philosophy
* documentation standards
* security requirements
* review expectations
* engineering philosophy
* operational governance

---

## Architecture Enforcement Rules → `.specify/memory/architecture_constitution.md`

Examples:

* controller/service boundaries
* DTO requirements
* validation placement
* async boundaries
* response contracts
* module ownership rules
* framework-specific architecture patterns

---

# Duplication Prevention Rules

DO NOT duplicate rules across both files.

If a rule exists in:

```text
.specify/memory/architecture_constitution.md
```

Then:

```text
.specify/memory/constitution.md
```

should reference architecture rules instead of repeating implementation details.

---

GOOD:

```text
.specify/memory/constitution.md:
- Architecture enforcement rules are defined in `.specify/memory/architecture_constitution.md`
```

```text
.specify/memory/architecture_constitution.md:
- Controllers must delegate business logic to Services or Actions
```

---

BAD:

Duplicating detailed architecture rules in both files.

---

# Constitution Synthesis Rules

DO NOT generate final documents until:

* enough information has been collected
* OR the user explicitly requests a draft

---

# Output Requirements

Generate or refine:

* `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
* `.specify/memory/architecture_constitution.md`
* `.specify/memory/security_constitution.md`

---

1. Project Identity
2. Engineering Philosophy
3. Security Expectations
4. Testing Expectations
5. Documentation Standards
6. Review Process
7. High-Level Architecture Intent

```

---

# Architecture Evolution Rules

Architecture rules may evolve over time.

When repeated architecture drift is detected:

* generate Constitution Update Proposals
* target `.specify/memory/architecture_constitution.md` by default
* only propose updates to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for governance-level changes

NEVER automatically modify either file.

---

# Reference Patterns

These are guidance patterns.

DO NOT automatically enforce them.

---

## Laravel Reference Patterns

* Thin Controllers
* Form Requests for validation
* Business logic in Services or Actions
* Explicit frontend contracts for Inertia
* Avoid leaking raw models to frontend
* Separate HTTP entry layer from domain logic

---

## NestJS Reference Patterns

* Thin Controllers
* Business logic in Services
* Strong Module boundaries
* DTO validation with ValidationPipe
* Explicit imports/exports between modules

---

## Next.js Reference Patterns

* Clear Server vs Client boundaries
* Server Components for data loading
* Avoid heavy logic in Server Actions
* Validate inputs using schemas
* Prefer Server Actions over unnecessary API routes

---

## Nuxt / Vue Reference Patterns

* Thin API handlers
* Organized composables
* Controlled global state
* Dedicated API abstraction layer
* Middleware only for cross-cutting concerns

---

# Final Rules

This command exists to help teams intentionally design:

* governance standards
* architecture boundaries
* evolution policies
* enforceable engineering systems

It must NOT:

* generate vague advice
* blindly enforce trends
* automatically rewrite architecture direction
* duplicate rules across constitutions

The generated constitutions must reflect intentional engineering decisions.
