# Architecture Guard — Nuxt.js Architecture Adapter

Use the core architecture review rules first. This adapter refines generic architecture concepts with **Nuxt 3/4** conventions. It focuses on Nitro server boundaries, Composable discipline, and the unique directory-based auto-import system.

---

## Boundary Mapping

When reviewing a Nuxt project, map generic architecture boundaries to Nuxt primitives:

### Entry Boundary

| Generic Concept | Nuxt Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Entry point for HTTP requests | Pages (`pages/`) |
| Entry point for API / Server Routes | Server Routes (`server/api/`, `server/routes/`) |
| Entry point for Server Hooks | Nitro Tasks / Server Plugins |
| Route request filtering | Middleware (`middleware/` or `server/middleware/`) |
| Layout/Container entry | Layouts (`layouts/`) |

### Validation Boundary

| Generic Concept | Nuxt Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Server input validation | `readBody` validation in Nitro or `h3` utilities |
| Frontend validation | Zod/VeeValidate in components or composables |
| Server query validation | `getQuery` validation in Nitro |

### Contract Boundary

| Generic Concept | Nuxt Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Stable request/response shapes | TypeScript Interfaces (often shared via `types/` or `server/utils`) |
| Auto-generated types | Nitro `internal` types (ensure they aren't leaked improperly) |

### Application Boundary

| Generic Concept | Nuxt Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Shared logic coordination | Composables (`composables/`) or Plugins |
| Server-side coordination | Server Utils (`server/utils/`) |
| Use case orchestration | Server Routes (delegating to server utils) |

### Domain Boundary

| Generic Concept | Nuxt Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Business rules and decisions | Utilities (`utils/`) or specialized domain folders |
| Domain models | TypeScript Entities |

### Data Boundary

| Generic Concept | Nuxt Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Persistence abstraction | Server-side Data Access (calling DB from `server/utils`) |
| Server storage | Nitro Storage layer |
| Fetching client | `$fetch` or `useFetch` with interceptors |

---

## Nuxt-Specific Detection Rules

### Nitro Server Discipline (The Server/Client Boundary)

Detect when:
- A frontend component or Composable attempts to import from `server/` (this is impossible at runtime but check for shared type leakage).
- Sensitive logic (secret keys, complex permissions) is placed in `composables/` or `utils/` (which are bundled to the client) instead of `server/utils/`.
- Large business workflows are implemented directly inside an `eventHandler` in `server/api/`.

### Composable Discipline

Detect when:
- A Composable is "Fat" (e.g., handles Auth, Data Fetching, and UI state all in one `useAuth()` hook).
- Composables are used to store global state instead of using **Pinia** (if Pinia is adopted in the Constitution).
- Composables have side effects that aren't properly cleaned up (e.g., event listeners without `onUnmounted`).

### Auto-Import Clarity

Detect when:
- Multiple functions with the same name exist in different directories (e.g., `utils/format.ts` and `composables/format.ts`), causing auto-import confusion.
- Third-party libraries are used without proper Nuxt plugin integration when the Constitution requires it.

### Missing Validation Boundary [Focus: api]

Detect when:
- Nitro routes use `readBody(event)` without immediate validation via a schema (e.g., Zod).
- Server routes return raw Database objects instead of transformed Response shapes.

## Common Nuxt Anti-Patterns to Flag

### 1. Fat Server Route (Logic Leakage)

```typescript
// ❌ Server route handles DB and logic
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const body = await readBody(event)
  const user = await db.user.create({ data: body })
  await sendEmail(user.email)
  return user
})
```

```typescript
// ✅ Server route delegates to server util
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const body = await readValidatedBody(event, userSchema.parse)
  return userService.register(body)
})
```

### 2. Leaky Utils

```typescript
// ❌ Sensitive logic in utils/ (bundled to client)
export const calculateTaxSecretly = (amount: number) => {
  const secretKey = '12345' // LEAKED
  return amount * 0.2
}
```

---

## Output Format

When this adapter is active, the architecture review should include a **Nuxt Conventions** section:

```text
Nuxt Conventions:
- Nitro Separation: [Clear / Leaky / Fat Routes]
- Composable Logic: [Focused / God-Composables / State-Heavy]
- Directory Discipline: [Standard / Non-standard / Tangled]
- Server-side Validation: [Strict / Weak / Missing]
```

---

## Guardrails

- Do not flag auto-imports as "missing imports" (this is the Nuxt way).
- Do not require a separate Service layer for simple Nitro endpoints.
- The Constitution is the final authority. This adapter provides Nuxt context, not overrides.
