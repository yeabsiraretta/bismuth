# Architecture Guard — Next.js Architecture Adapter

Use the core architecture review rules first. This adapter refines generic architecture concepts with **Next.js (App Router)** conventions. It specifically focuses on the React Server Component (RSC) boundary, Server Action orchestration, and data fetching isolation.

---

## Boundary Mapping

When reviewing a Next.js project, map generic architecture boundaries to Next.js primitives:

### Entry Boundary

| Generic Concept | Next.js Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Entry point for HTTP requests | Pages (`page.tsx`) |
| Entry point for API / Webhooks | Route Handlers (`route.ts`) |
| Entry point for user actions | Server Actions (`'use server'`) |
| Entry point for layout/nesting | Layouts (`layout.tsx`) |
| Global request filtering | Middleware (`middleware.ts`) |
| Client-side entry points | Client Components (`'use client'`) |

### Validation Boundary

| Generic Concept | Next.js Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Input validation | Zod / Yup / Valibot schemas |
| Server Action validation | Schema parsing inside the Action or `zsa` / `next-safe-action` |
| Route Handler validation | Schema parsing of `request.json()` or `searchParams` |

### Contract Boundary

| Generic Concept | Next.js Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Stable request shapes | Zod Schemas or TypeScript Interfaces |
| Stable response shapes | Route Handler return types or Server Action return types |
| Component contracts | Component Props (TypeScript interfaces) |

### Application Boundary

| Generic Concept | Next.js Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Use case coordination | Service Layer (`lib/services/`) or Server Actions |
| Data loading coordination | Server Components (calling data access layers) |
| Revalidation logic | `revalidatePath`, `revalidateTag` |

### Domain Boundary

| Generic Concept | Next.js Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Business rules and decisions | Pure Domain Functions (agnostic of Next.js) |
| Domain models | TypeScript Entities or Database Models |

### Data Boundary

| Generic Concept | Next.js Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Persistence abstraction | Data Access Layer (DAL - `lib/data/`) |
| Query building | Prisma, Drizzle, or Kysely clients |
| Cache management | `unstable_cache`, `fetch` cache options |

### Presentation Boundary

| Generic Concept | Next.js Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Server-rendered UI | React Server Components (RSC) |
| Client-side interactivity | Client Components (`'use client'`) |
| Global state | Context Providers or Zustand/Jotai stores |
| Meta information | `metadata` exports or `generateMetadata()` |

---

## Next.js-Specific Detection Rules

### The RSC vs. Client Boundary

Detect when:
- A Client Component (`'use client'`) contains heavy business logic or performs direct database queries (impossible by design, but check for "leaky" abstractions).
- Sensitive data is passed from an RSC to a Client Component without filtering (e.g., passing a full `user` object with a hashed password).
- An RSC is marked as `'use client'` unnecessarily, increasing bundle size.

### Server Action Responsibility

Detect when:
- Server Actions contain massive business workflows (they should delegate to a Service layer).
- Server Actions are used for "data fetching" instead of RSCs (Server Actions are for mutations).
- Server Actions lack proper error handling, leaking raw server errors to the client.

### Data Fetching Isolation [Focus: db]

Detect when:
- Components (RSC or Client) import database clients (Prisma/Drizzle) directly instead of using a Data Access Layer (DAL).
- Database queries are duplicated across multiple `page.tsx` files instead of being in a shared `lib/data/` file.
- `unstable_cache` is used without clear tags, making revalidation difficult.

### Missing Validation Boundary [Focus: api]

Detect when:
- Server Actions use `formData.get()` directly without parsing via a schema (e.g., Zod).
- Route Handlers process `request.json()` without validation.
- `searchParams` are used in Pages without type-safe parsing.

## Common Next.js Anti-Patterns to Flag

### 1. Database Leak in Component

```tsx
// ❌ RSC handles raw DB query
export default async function Page() {
  const users = await prisma.user.findMany({ ... }); // Direct DB access
  return <UserList users={users} />;
}
```

```tsx
// ✅ RSC calls DAL
import { getUsers } from "@/lib/data/users";

export default async function Page() {
  const users = await getUsers();
  return <UserList users={users} />;
}
```

### 2. Massive Server Action

```tsx
// ❌ Action owns the entire workflow
'use server'
export async function updateProfile(data: any) {
  const validated = schema.parse(data);
  const user = await db.user.update({ ... });
  await sendEmail(user.email);
  await logAction(user.id);
  revalidatePath('/profile');
}
```

## Output Format

When this adapter is active, the architecture review should include a **Next.js Conventions** section:

```text
Next.js Conventions:
- RSC Boundary: [Clean / Mixed / Leaky] — [prop check]
- Data Fetching: [DAL-based / Component-based / Mixed]
- Server Actions: [Coordinators / Logic-Heavy / Missing Validation]
- Bundle Optimization: [Optimized / Heavy Client-side]
```

---

## Guardrails

- Do not flag Next.js-specific optimizations (cache, prefetch) as violations.
- Do not require a separate Service layer if the project is a simple blog or marketing site.
- The Constitution is the final authority. This adapter provides Next.js context, not overrides.
