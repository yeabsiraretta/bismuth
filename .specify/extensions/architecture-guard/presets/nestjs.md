# Architecture Guard — NestJS Architecture Adapter

Use the core architecture review rules first. This adapter refines generic architecture concepts with **NestJS** conventions. It specifically focuses on Module-based encapsulation, Dependency Injection (DI) discipline, and the clear separation of Controllers, Providers, and Middlewares.

---

## Boundary Mapping

When reviewing a NestJS project, map generic architecture boundaries to NestJS primitives:

### Entry Boundary

| Generic Concept | NestJS Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Entry point for HTTP requests | Controllers (`@Controller()`) |
| Entry point for GraphQL | Resolvers (`@Resolver()`) |
| Entry point for WebSockets | Gateways (`@WebSocketGateway()`) |
| Entry point for Microservices | Message Handlers (`@MessagePattern()`, `@EventPattern()`) |
| Request/Response transformation | Interceptors (`@Injectable() implements NestInterceptor`) |
| Global/Route request filtering | Middlewares (`implements NestMiddleware`) |
| Authentication / Authorization | Guards (`@Injectable() implements CanActivate`) |

### Validation Boundary

| Generic Concept | NestJS Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Input validation and transformation | Pipes (`@Injectable() implements PipeTransform`) |
| Standard Validation | `ValidationPipe` (using `class-validator`) |
| Schema-based validation | Joi or Zod Pipes |

### Contract Boundary

| Generic Concept | NestJS Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Stable request shapes | DTOs (Data Transfer Objects - `class` based) |
| Stable response shapes | DTOs or GraphQL Object Types |
| Shared interfaces | TypeScript Interfaces or Abstract Classes |
| Microservice message shapes | DTOs or Protobuf definitions |

### Application Boundary

| Generic Concept | NestJS Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Use case coordination | Services / Providers (`@Injectable()`) |
| Business logic orchestration | CQRS Command/Query Handlers (`@CommandHandler()`) |
| Event coordination | Event Emitter (`@OnEvent()`) |

### Domain Boundary

| Generic Concept | NestJS Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Business rules and decisions | Pure Domain Classes (agnostic of NestJS) |
| Domain models | Entities (TypeORM, Prisma, or Sequelize) |
| Access control logic | Domain Services or Guard logic |

### Data Boundary

| Generic Concept | NestJS Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Persistence abstraction | Repositories (Standard or Custom `@EntityRepository()`) |
| Query building | Query Builders or Prisma Clients |
| Persistence orchestration | Modules wrapping Database Clients |

## NestJS-Specific Detection Rules

### Module Encapsulation (The "Exports" Rule)

Detect when:
- A service from `Module A` is injected into `Module B` without being listed in `Module A`'s `exports` array.
- Circular dependencies are handled via `forwardRef()` without a documented architectural reason (this often indicates poor boundary design).
- Global modules (`@Global()`) are used excessively to bypass explicit importing.

### Fat Controllers

Detect when a controller:
- Directly performs database operations (e.g., using `this.repo.save()`).
- Coordinates complex business logic across multiple services.
- Manually handles HTTP status codes and error messages based on business logic (this should be in Interceptors or Exceptions).

**Acceptable in controllers:**
- Using `@Body()`, `@Query()`, `@Param()` to extract data.
- Calling a single Service/Handler method.
- Using `@UseGuards()`, `@UseInterceptors()`, or `@UsePipes()`.

### Dependency Injection Discipline

Detect when:
- A service uses `new ServiceName()` to instantiate another service instead of using constructor injection.
- Providers are "leaked" via global variables or static methods.
- Services are injected with a broader scope than necessary (e.g., Request scope when Singleton is sufficient).

### DTO and Validation Discipline [Focus: api]

Detect when:
- `@Body()` is typed as `any`, `Record<string, any>`, or a raw interface (Interfaces are removed at runtime, making `ValidationPipe` ineffective).
- DTO classes lack `class-validator` decorators (e.g., `@IsString()`, `@IsEmail()`).
- The API returns raw Database Entities instead of specialized Response DTOs.

### Exception Handling Boundary

Detect when:
- Business logic throws raw `Error` objects instead of specialized `HttpException` or `RpcException` classes.
- Controllers use `try/catch` for flow control instead of using global **Exception Filters**.

## Common NestJS Anti-Patterns to Flag

### 1. Fat Controller (Logic Leakage)

```typescript
// ❌ Controller handles business decisions
@Post()
async create(@Body() dto: CreateUserDto) {
  const existing = await this.userRepo.findOne({ email: dto.email });
  if (existing) throw new BadRequestException('User exists');
  // ... more logic
  return this.userRepo.save(dto);
}
```

```typescript
// ✅ Controller delegates
@Post()
async create(@Body() dto: CreateUserDto) {
  return this.userService.register(dto);
}
```

### 2. DI Bypass

```typescript
// ❌ Creating instances manually
@Injectable()
export class OrderService {
  private readonly logger = new MyLogger(); // Bypasses DI
}
```

---

## Output Format

When this adapter is active, the architecture review should include a **NestJS Conventions** section:

```text
NestJS Conventions:
- Encapsulation: [Strict / Leaky / Global] — [exports/imports check]
- Controller Responsibility: [Delegated / Fat / Mixed]
- DI Pattern: [Constructor-based / Bypassed / Static]
- DTO Discipline: [Strict / Weak / Missing]
- Module Boundaries: [Clear / Circular / Tangled]
```

---

## Guardrails

- Do not flag standard NestJS patterns (Guards, Interceptors) as violations unless they contradict the Constitution.
- Do not require CQRS unless the Constitution adopts it.
- The Constitution is the final authority. This adapter provides NestJS context, not overrides.
