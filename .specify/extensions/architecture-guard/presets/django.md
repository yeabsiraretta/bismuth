# Architecture Guard — Django Architecture Adapter

Use the core architecture review rules first. This adapter refines generic architecture concepts with **Django (MVT)** conventions. It specifically focuses on resolving the "Fat Model" vs. "Service Layer" debate and ensuring proper boundary isolation in Python-based systems.

---

## Boundary Mapping

When reviewing a Django project, map generic architecture boundaries to Django primitives:

### Entry Boundary

| Generic Concept | Django Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Entry point for HTTP requests | Views (`views.py` - Function-based or Class-based) |
| URL routing and dispatch | URLs (`urls.py`) |
| Entry point for CLI commands | Management Commands (`management/commands/`) |
| Entry point for background work | Celery Tasks / RQ Jobs (`tasks.py`) |
| Global request/response hooks | Middleware (`middleware.py`) |
| Entry point for internal events | Signal Receivers (`signals.py`) |
| Entry point for scheduled work | Celery Beat / Cron jobs |

### Validation Boundary

| Generic Concept | Django Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Input validation and normalization | Forms (`forms.py`) or ModelForms |
| API input validation | DRF Serializers (`serializers.py`) or Pydantic models |
| Query parameter validation | FilterSets (django-filter) or manual form validation |
| Custom validation logic | `clean()` methods or custom Validator functions |

### Contract Boundary

| Generic Concept | Django Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Stable request shapes | Forms, Serializers, or TypedDicts |
| Stable response shapes | Serializers, Template Context dictionaries |
| Shared interfaces | Abstract Base Classes (ABC) or Protocols |
| Data transfer objects | Dataclasses, Pydantic Models, or NamedTuples |
| Event contracts | Signal definitions or Message schemas |

### Application Boundary

| Generic Concept | Django Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Use case coordination | Service Layer (`services.py`) or "Selectors" (`selectors.py`) |
| Multi-step workflows | Service functions coordinating multiple models/tasks |
| Transaction coordination | `@transaction.atomic` decorated services |

### Domain Boundary

| Generic Concept | Django Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Business rules and decisions | Domain classes, Utility functions, or Model methods |
| Domain models | Django Models (`models.py`) |
| Access control logic | Model methods or custom Permission classes |
| Domain enums | `models.TextChoices` or `models.IntegerChoices` |
| Scoped queries | Custom QuerySets (`as_manager()`) or Managers |

### Data Boundary

| Generic Concept | Django Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Persistence abstraction | Django ORM (`models.py`, `managers.py`) |
| Query building | Managers and QuerySets |
| Schema management | Migrations (`migrations/`) |
| Seed data | Fixtures or Factory Boy / Mixer factories |

### Integration Boundary

| Generic Concept | Django Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| External HTTP calls | `requests` or `httpx` wrappers in `integrations/` |
| External service wrappers | Specialized client classes |
| File storage | Django Storage backend (`DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE`) |
| External Auth | Authentication Backends |

### Presentation Boundary

| Generic Concept | Django Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Server-rendered views | Django Templates (`.html`) |
| Context preparation | `get_context_data()` in CBVs or context processors |
| API output formatting | DRF Serializers or JSON responses |
| Template logic isolation | Template Tags and Filters (`templatetags/`) |

## Django-Specific Detection Rules

### Views Should Be Thin

Detect when a view:
- Contains complex ORM queries (more than a simple `.get()` or `.filter()`).
- Directly coordinates multi-step business workflows.
- Performs external API calls or sends emails (these should be delegated).
- Manually handles complex error mapping instead of using Forms/Serializers.

**Acceptable in views:**
- Extracting parameters from `request`.
- Calling a Form/Serializer for validation.
- Calling a single Service or Selector function.
- Handling `HttpResponseRedirect` or rendering a template.

### The "Fat Model" Boundary

Detect when a model:
- Directly calls external services (HTTP, email, etc.).
- Coordinates changes across *other* unrelated models (orchestration).
- Contains logic that depends on the `request` object (this is an entry layer leak).
- Grows beyond ~400 lines (consider moving logic to `services.py` or `selectors.py`).

**Acceptable in models:**
- Field definitions and Meta options.
- Custom `save()` for internal data integrity.
- Property methods for simple derived data.
- Domain-specific logic that only affects the current instance.

### Signal Discipline (Anti-Pattern: Hidden Side Effects)

Detect when signals:
- Are used for business logic that could be in a Service.
- Perform heavy database writes or external calls synchronously.
- Create circular dependencies between apps.

**Recommendation**: Use signals only for cross-cutting concerns (e.g., creating a Profile when a User is created) or integrating with third-party apps that don't know about your services.

### Forms and Serializers as Gatekeepers [Focus: api]

Detect when:
- Views directly use `request.POST` or `request.data` without a Form/Serializer.
- Business logic is duplicated between a Form and a Service.
- Serializers leak internal database fields (like `id` when using UUIDs, or `password_hash`).

### QuerySet Isolation [Focus: db]

Detect when:
- Complex query logic (e.g., `.annotate(total=...)`) is written in a View instead of a custom **Manager** or **QuerySet**.
- Views or Services perform N+1 queries by missing `select_related()` or `prefetch_related()`.

## Common Django Anti-Patterns to Flag

### 1. Fat View (Orchestration in Entry Layer)

```python
# ❌ View handles everything
def create_order(request):
    data = request.POST
    user = request.user
    if user.balance < data['amount']:
        return error(...)
    order = Order.objects.create(user=user, amount=data['amount'])
    send_mail(...)
    logger.info(...)
    return render(...)
```

```python
# ✅ View delegates to Service
def create_order(request):
    form = OrderForm(request.POST)
    if form.is_valid():
        order_service.create_order(user=request.user, **form.cleaned_data)
        return redirect(...)
```

### 2. Leaky Templates

```html
<!-- ❌ Complex logic in template -->
{% if user.is_authenticated and user.profile.member_type == 'gold' and order.total > 100 %}
  <p>Free Shipping!</p>
{% endif %}
```

```python
# ✅ Logic in Model property or Service
@property
def qualifies_for_free_shipping(self):
    return self.user.is_gold and self.total > 100
```

## Output Format

When this adapter is active, the architecture review should include a **Django Conventions** section:

```text
Django Conventions:
- Views: [Thin / Mixed / Fat] — [details]
- Logic Placement: [Service Layer / Fat Models / Mixed]
- Validation: [Forms|Serializers / Manual]
- DB Discipline: [Custom Managers / Inline Queries]
- Signal Usage: [Clean / Excessive Side-Effects]
```

---

## Guardrails

- Do not flag standard Django features (Signals, Middlewares) unless they violate the Constitution.
- Do not force a Service layer if the project is a simple CRUD app.
- The Constitution is the final authority. This adapter provides Django context, not overrides.
