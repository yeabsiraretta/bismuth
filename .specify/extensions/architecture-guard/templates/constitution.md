# Project Constitution

> This is the governance document that Architecture Guard reads alongside the architecture constitution.
> Fill in each section with project-level engineering standards.
> If a section does not apply, mark it as "Not applicable" rather than deleting it.

## Project Identity

- **Name**: [Your project name]
- **Type**: [Monolith / Modular Monolith / Microservices / Full-stack / Library / Other]
- **Primary Stack**: [e.g., Laravel + Vue, NestJS + React, Django + HTMX]

## Engineering Philosophy

> List the non-negotiable principles that shape engineering decisions.

1. [e.g., Prefer small, reviewable changes over large rewrites.]
2. [e.g., Decisions with long-term impact must be documented.]
3. [e.g., User-facing behavior must remain traceable to the feature specification.]

## Security Expectations

- [e.g., Public entry points must validate and authorize access before processing.]
- [e.g., Secrets must never be committed or exposed to client-side code.]
- [e.g., Security-sensitive changes require explicit review.]

## Testing Expectations

- [e.g., New behavior must include automated tests at the right level.]
- [e.g., Regression fixes must include a failing test when practical.]
- [e.g., Architecture refactors should preserve existing behavior.]

## Documentation Standards

- [e.g., Architectural decisions are documented before they become standards.]
- [e.g., Public APIs and cross-team contracts must be documented.]
- [e.g., Known deviations must include rationale and review date.]

## Review Process

- [e.g., P0 findings block release until resolved or explicitly waived.]
- [e.g., Non-blocking architecture drift becomes tracked refactor work.]
- [e.g., Changes to governance standards require team review.]

## High-Level Architecture Intent

Detailed architecture enforcement rules live in `.specify/memory/architecture_constitution.md`.

- **Architecture style**: [Monolith / Modular Monolith / Microservices / Full-stack / Library / Other]
- **Consistency goal**: [e.g., Keep feature modules independently understandable.]
- **Evolution policy**: [e.g., Use Constitution Update Proposals for new architecture standards.]

## Accepted Deviations

> List intentional governance-level exceptions. Architecture-specific deviations belong in `.specify/memory/architecture_constitution.md`.

- [e.g., The reporting module is exempt from the current documentation standard until Q3 migration.]

## Governance and Evolution Policy

- [e.g., Governance changes require explicit approval.]
- [e.g., Architecture enforcement changes should target `.specify/memory/architecture_constitution.md`.]
- [e.g., Repeated drift should trigger an Architecture Constitution Update Proposal.]

## Blocking vs Non-Blocking Rules

> By default, architecture violations are non-blocking and generate refactor tasks.
> List governance-level rules that MUST block release:

- [e.g., P0: Security-sensitive changes cannot merge without review.]
- [e.g., P0: Public API behavior must be tested before release.]

## Notes

- This Constitution is versioned alongside the codebase.
- Update it through a Constitution Update Proposal when patterns evolve.
- Architecture Guard uses this document for governance and `.specify/memory/architecture_constitution.md` for architecture enforcement.
