# Security Review — Follow-Up Planning

## User Input

$ARGUMENTS

## Objective

Turn the latest security review findings, unresolved security tasks, or a pasted finding list into an actionable follow-up plan.

Use this command when you want to:

- turn a finding into a concrete Spec-Kit task
- defer a finding as technical debt with a clear rationale
- avoid duplicating work that is already tracked in unfinished tasks
- carry unresolved findings forward into the next implementation cycle
- prepare items that can later be written into `tasks.md` or `plan.md` with `/speckit.security-review.apply`

If the user provides a review report or finding list in `$ARGUMENTS`, treat it as the source of truth for the follow-up plan. If no findings are provided, look for a pasted report, a named report file, or the current backlog context. If none is available, ask the user for the report or findings before proceeding.

When project memory exists, use it as design context. Compare the follow-up choices against the project memory hub, architecture decisions, and any repository-native memory artifacts the team uses to preserve intent.

## Scope

Before planning follow-ups, check the Spec-Kit memory hub context.

### Optimizer-Aware Flow

When `.specify/extensions/memory-md/config.yml` has `optimizer.enabled: true` and the CLI is available:

1. **Prepare Context**: Execute `/speckit.memory-md.prepare-context --feature specs/<feature> --query "security constraints vulnerabilities authentication authorization data-leakage"`.
2. **Read Synthesis**: Read `specs/<feature>/memory-synthesis.md` (or the search results) first.

### Markdown-Only Flow

When the optimizer is disabled or unavailable, you **MUST** read these files explicitly using your file-reading tools (absolute or relative paths). Do not rely solely on workspace search or semantic indexers, as these files are often in `.gitignore`:

- recent security review reports or pasted findings
- `tasks.md`
- `plan.md`
- `spec.md`
- `research.md`
- `data-model.md`
- `contracts/`
- `quickstart.md`
- `docs/memory/INDEX.md`
- `docs/memory/`
- `specs/<feature>/memory.md`
- `specs/<feature>/memory-synthesis.md`
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Other project memory or architecture notes

## What to Check

- Findings are not already covered by an existing task
- High-severity issues are marked for immediate remediation
- Lower-severity issues can be deferred only with an explicit technical-debt rationale
- Deferred items include a revisit trigger or milestone
- New tasks are sequenced so secure foundations come first
- Follow-up work remains testable and reviewable
- Security tasks can reference incomplete findings or partially resolved work without losing context
- The follow-up plan preserves the intent of the memory hub context and the current implementation

## Resolution Choices

For each finding, choose one of these outcomes:

1. `Implement now`
2. `Track as technical debt`
3. `Already covered`

When you choose `Track as technical debt`, include:

- why the item is safe to defer
- what risk remains
- what condition should trigger re-review
- the target feature, milestone, or release if known

## Steps

1. Read the latest security review findings or the finding list provided in `$ARGUMENTS`.
2. Read `tasks.md` and any related planning artifacts to identify unfinished security work.
3. Compare the findings against the current task backlog and memory hub context.
4. Group the findings into immediate remediation, technical debt, and already-covered items.
5. Generate Spec-Kit-ready follow-up tasks for the items that should be implemented now.
6. Capture any deferred findings as technical-debt entries with a revisit trigger.
7. **Durable Memory Preservation (Mandatory Check)**: If the follow-up planning identified systemic security lessons or reusable patterns, you **MUST** execute `/speckit.memory-md.capture` after providing the plan. Use the formal capture flow to propose entries and wait for user approval.

## Document Header

Before writing the follow-up plan body, emit a YAML frontmatter block at the very start of the output document. Populate all values from your analysis. Copy the `field_summaries` section verbatim — it is static schema documentation that enables any LLM or indexer reading only the header to understand the full field schema without parsing the document body.

Then follow with the follow-up plan body.

## Output Format

Produce a structured Markdown follow-up plan with:

- Executive summary
- Inputs reviewed
- Resolution decisions
- Immediate remediation tasks
- Technical debt backlog
- Already covered items
- Confirmed secure patterns

## Backlog-Ready Task Format

Use this format for every item that should become a task or backlog entry:

| Task ID | Title | Severity | Type | Source Finding | Depends On | Acceptance Criteria |
| ------- | ----- | -------- | ---- | -------------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| TASK-SEC-001 | Example remediation task | High | Implement | SEC-001 | TASK-SEC-000 | Fix verified by test and review |

For technical debt items, use `Type = Technical Debt` and include a revisit trigger in the description.
For already covered items, include the existing task or PR reference so the backlog stays deduplicated.

If the user provided multiple findings, group them into:

- immediate remediation tasks
- technical debt items
- already covered items

Each new task should stay compatible with the Spec-Kit task style used by the review commands:

- `TASK-SEC-[NNN]`
- severity
- category or OWASP mapping
- location or source finding
- description
- acceptance criteria
- references or related artifacts

## Memory Hub INDEX.md Row

After the follow-up plan, output the following proposed routing row for the user to paste into their `docs/memory/INDEX.md`. This enables LLM-based filtering without loading the full document.

```text
| <relative path where this doc is saved> | followup | <assessment_date> | <overall_risk> | C:<critical_count> H:<high_count> M:<medium_count> L:<low_count> | <owasp_categories comma-separated> |
```

Example:

```text
| docs/security-reviews/2026-05-07-auth-followup.md | followup | 2026-05-07 | HIGH | C:2 H:4 M:6 L:4 | A01,A05,A07 |
```

See `docs/field-registry.md` in the security-review-extension for the full INDEX.md table format and SQLite Phase 1 column mapping.
