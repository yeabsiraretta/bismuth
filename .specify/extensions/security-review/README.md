## What Is This?

A Spec Kit extension that performs **security reviews at every stage of delivery** — from plan to implementation — and turns findings into structured, trackable remediation tasks.

It answers one question:

> Is this work secure, and if not, what exactly needs to be fixed?

## The Problem It Solves

AI generates code that works, but it doesn't think about security:

- It concatenates user input into SQL queries because that's the fastest path
- It skips authorization checks on admin endpoints because "it's internal"
- It hardcodes API keys in config files because the test passes
- It adds dependencies without checking for known CVEs

You discover these issues in code review — or worse, in production. By then, fixing them is expensive and disruptive.

**Security Review catches these issues early** by reviewing your specs, plans, task lists, staged changes, branch diffs, and full codebase against OWASP 2025, secure coding practices, and your project's own security context.

## What It Actually Does

## Extension Interoperability

This extension acts as a cooperative citizen in the Spec Kit ecosystem by sharing context through explicit handoff artifacts in the `specs/<feature>/` directory.

**The Governed Delivery Lifecycle:**
1. **`/specify`** -> Write initial feature spec.
2. **`/speckit.architecture-guard.governed-plan`** -> Orchestrates memory synthesis, technical planning, and security/architecture validation.
3. **`/speckit.architecture-guard.governed-tasks`** -> Orchestrates task generation with memory, security, and architecture refactor awareness.
4. **`/speckit.architecture-guard.governed-implement`** -> Orchestrates implementation with memory context and post-implementation governance review.

By using explicit markdown files, extensions remain decoupled, and all constraints and decisions are fully reviewable in Git.

# Recommended Security Lifecycle

Security Review is a **governance and audit layer** that runs at every phase of Spec Kit delivery to catch vulnerabilities before they reach production.

| Milestone | Recommended Command | Phase Integration | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Milestone: Design** | `security-review.plan` | After `/plan` | Review technical design for trust boundaries and insecure patterns. |
| **Milestone: Strategy** | `security-review.tasks` | After `/tasks` | Ensure security requirements are sequenced correctly in the task list. |
| **Milestone: Verification** | `security-review.branch` | After `/implement` | Focused security review of the current changes or branch. |
| **Milestone: Remediation** | `security-review.apply` | After findings | Inject approved security fixes into your Plan and Task artifacts. |

---

## How to Handle Findings

Security Review generates structured reports with actionable findings. To resolve them:

### 1. Evaluate the Finding
Review the **Exploit Scenario** and **Remediation** provided in the report. Decide if the finding is a valid risk that needs fixing or an accepted project design.

### 2. Plan the Follow-up
Run `/speckit.security-review.followup`.
The AI will guide you through each finding. You can choose to **Fix Now** (add to current tasks) or **Track as Tech Debt** (save for later).

### 3. Apply the Fixes
Run `/speckit.security-review.apply`.
This will **automatically inject** the remediation tasks into your `plan.md` and `tasks.md`, making security part of your standard delivery flow.

---

## Continuous Security (Out-of-Band)

These commands are ideal for pre-commit hooks or automated PR checks to ensure incremental changes remain secure.

| Context | Recommended Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Pre-Commit** | `security-review.staged` | Review only files staged with `git add`. |
| **Pre-Merge** | `security-review.branch` | Review changes introduced by your branch (auto-detects current). |

---

### Key Behavior: Structured, Actionable Output

Every finding includes severity, location, OWASP category, exploit scenario, remediation, and a Spec Kit task ID:

```text
### [CRITICAL] SQL Injection in User Authentication

**Location:** src/auth/login.js:45
**OWASP Category:** A05:2025-Injection
**Description:** User input concatenated directly into SQL query...
**Exploit Scenario:** Attacker could bypass authentication by...
**Remediation:** Use parameterized queries or ORM...
**Spec-Kit Task:** TASK-SEC-001
```

## Benefits

### Compared to Spec Kit Alone

| Spec Kit Only | Spec Kit + Security Review |
| --- | --- |
| Security issues found during code review or production | Caught during planning, before code is written |
| No structured way to track security debt | Every finding becomes a `TASK-SEC-NNN` with severity and acceptance criteria |
| AI generates insecure patterns without feedback | AI output is reviewed against OWASP 2025 and secure coding practices |
| Security is a vague checkbox | Security coverage is enumerated: OWASP, supply chain, secrets, DevSecOps |

### Compared to Traditional Security Tools

| Traditional Tools | Security Review |
| --- | --- |
| Require language-specific scanners per framework | Framework-agnostic, works across any stack |
| Run against code only | Reviews plans, tasks, staged diffs, branch diffs, AND code |
| Produce generic reports | Produces Spec Kit task IDs ready for your backlog |
| Separate workflow from development | Integrated into the Spec Kit delivery lifecycle |
| Expensive to set up and maintain | Zero runtime dependencies, prompt-based |

## Security Coverage

### OWASP Top 10 (2025)

| Code | Category |
| --- | --- |
| A01 | Broken Access Control (includes SSRF) |
| A02 | Security Misconfiguration |
| A03 | Software Supply Chain Failures |
| A04 | Cryptographic Failures |
| A05 | Injection |
| A06 | Insecure Design |
| A07 | Authentication Failures |
| A08 | Software or Data Integrity Failures |
| A09 | Security Logging & Alerting Failures |
| A10 | Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions |

### Additional Coverage

- Input validation and output encoding
- Secrets management and cryptographic handling
- Session and API security
- Trust boundaries and attack surface review
- Dependency, build, and CI/CD risk analysis
- STRIDE threat modeling (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Info Disclosure, DoS, Elevation of Privilege)

## When To Use It

**Use it when:**

- Your project handles **user input, authentication, or sensitive data**
- You're using **AI-assisted development** and want security checks on AI output
- Your team needs **structured security tracking** (not just "we should fix this")
- You want **pre-commit or pre-merge security gates** without blocking tooling
- You need **OWASP coverage** documented for compliance or audit purposes

**Best fit:**

- Web applications and APIs
- Projects with authentication, payments, or user data
- Teams that need security review integrated into their delivery flow
- Codebases with third-party dependencies to monitor

## When NOT To Use It

**Don't use it for:**

- **Static sites with no backend** — there's minimal attack surface
- **Internal scripts with no user input** — no trust boundaries to review
- **Replacing a penetration test** — this is prompt-based review, not runtime testing
- **Replacing dependency scanners** — it checks for known patterns, not CVE databases in real-time
- **Projects with no security requirements** — if security doesn't matter, skip it

**The honest test:** If your project never handles user input, authentication, or sensitive data, you probably don't need this.

# Quick Start

1. See [Installation](#installation) section for all methods.

2. Run a security review:
   ```text
   /speckit.security-review.branch
   ```

3. Turn findings into tasks:
   ```text
   /speckit.security-review.followup
   ```

4. Apply approved tasks to your plan:
   ```text
   /speckit.security-review.apply
   ```

For normal feature development, prefer `branch` review after implementation. Use `audit` for broader pre-release or milestone reviews.

---

## Choosing the Right Security Review Scope

Security Review supports different review scopes depending on the development stage.

Not every workflow requires a full-codebase security audit.

During normal Spec Kit implementation workflows, prefer:

```text
/speckit.security-review.branch
```

Use:

```text
/speckit.security-review.audit
```

for:

* release reviews
* milestone reviews
* major architecture changes
* systemic security analysis
* broader trust-boundary validation

## Avoid Overusing Full Audits

Running full security audits during every implementation cycle may create:

- noisy findings
- duplicated review output
- slower development workflows
- governance fatigue

Prefer scoped review during active feature development.

Use full audits intentionally.

## Recommended Spec Kit Workflow Usage

### During Feature Development

Recommended flow:

```text
/specify
↓
security review on specification
↓
/plan
↓
security review on plan
↓
/tasks
↓
/implement
↓
/speckit.security-review.branch
```

This keeps security review focused on the current feature implementation.

### During Pre-Release or Major Review Cycles

Recommended flow:

```text
release candidate
↓
/speckit.security-review.audit
```

Use `audit` for:

* release reviews
* milestone reviews
* major architecture changes
* systemic security analysis
* broader trust-boundary validation

## Governance Artifacts

Security Review respects the following project governance artifacts when they exist:

| Artifact | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `security_constitution.md` | **The Source of Truth.** Repository-wide security rules, standards, and requirements that every feature must follow. |
| `specs/<feature>/security-constraints.md` | Feature-specific security rules generated during planning or specification. |
| `docs/memory/` | Durable repository memory containing historical security decisions. |

## Optimizer-Aware Memory Retrieval

This extension integrates with [spec-kit-memory-hub](https://github.com/DyanGalih/spec-kit-memory-hub)'s local SQLite optimizer. When enabled, the extension uses the `speckit-memory` CLI to perform targeted searches across your project's durable memory rather than reading full directories.

To enable this:
1. Ensure `spec-kit-memory-hub` is installed.
2. Set `optimizer.enabled: true` in your `.specify/extensions/memory-md/config.yml`.
3. The security review agent will automatically switch to the **Optimizer-Aware Flow** (Refresh -> Search -> Synthesize -> Read).

## Command Details

### Full Audit

```text
/speckit.security-review.audit
/speckit.security-review.audit focus on authentication, secrets handling, and payment flows
/speckit.security-review.audit review only the api and worker directories
```

Performs broader or full-system security review across the codebase. Recommended for milestone reviews, release reviews, or major architecture validation.

### Staged Changes (Pre-Commit)

```text
/speckit.security-review.staged
/speckit.security-review.staged focus on secrets and injection
```

Reviews only files staged with `git add`. If nothing is staged, it tells you.

### Branch / PR Diff (Pre-Merge)

```text
/speckit.security-review.branch
/speckit.security-review.branch feature/payment-gateway
/speckit.security-review.branch feature/payment-gateway develop
```

Reviews security risks introduced by the current branch or implementation changes. Recommended for normal feature development workflows.

By default, it detects your **current active branch** and compares it against its **original source** (main, develop, etc.). You can also specify branches explicitly if needed.

### Example: Feature Development

```text
/speckit.implement
↓
/speckit.security-review.branch
```

Reviews only the current implementation changes.

### Example: Pre-Release Review

```text
release candidate
↓
/speckit.security-review.audit
```

Performs broader review across the codebase.

### Plan Review

```text
/speckit.security-review.plan
```

Reviews the implementation plan for missing security requirements and unsafe assumptions. Run after `/speckit.plan`.

### Task Review

```text
/speckit.security-review.tasks
```

Checks that security tasks exist and are properly sequenced. Run after `/speckit.tasks`.

### Follow-Up Planning

```text
/speckit.security-review.followup
```

Converts findings into remediation tasks (`Implement now`), technical debt (`Track as technical debt`), or marks them as already covered.

### Apply Follow-Ups

```text
/speckit.security-review.apply
```

Writes approved security tasks into `tasks.md` and `plan.md`. Supports dry-run preview.

### Formal Report Export

Synthesizes multiple review artifacts into a single, professional **Whitebox Security Assessment Report**.

```text
/speckit.security-review.export
```

Use this when you need to provide a formal report to stakeholders or clients. It produces:
- **Executive Summary**: High-level risk and business impact.
- **Technical Findings**: Detailed exploit walk-throughs and code-level remediation.
- **Strategic Roadmap**: Long-term security hardening advice based on project memory.

## With Companion Extensions

| Extension | Relationship |
| --- | --- |
| **Memory Hub** | Security Review reads `docs/memory/`, `specs/<feature>/memory-synthesis.md`, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` as design context. Optional but recommended. |
| **Architecture Guard** | Routes architecture-only findings to Architecture Guard. Security Review keeps security findings. No duplication. |

## Using Security Review with Architecture Guard

When used with Architecture Guard orchestration workflows:

- `governed-plan` should use plan-level security review
- `governed-tasks` should use task-level security review
- `governed-implement` should generally prefer:

```text
/speckit.security-review.branch
```

for implementation validation

Architecture Guard orchestration should only use:

```text
/speckit.security-review.audit
```

for broader governance or release-level workflows.

# Configuration

### When You Need to Configure

Configuration is **optional**. You only need it if:
- Your project has custom security requirements
- You want to exclude certain patterns or directories
- You need to customize severity thresholds
- You want to focus on specific OWASP categories

### How to Configure

Copy `config-template.yml` into your project as a team brief:

```bash
cp config-template.yml speckit-security.yml
```

> **Note:** The extension is prompt-driven and does not read this file automatically. Use it as a human-readable team brief, and include relevant settings in your slash-command input when you want the agent to follow them.

The template covers: exclusion patterns, focus areas, severity thresholds, output settings, OWASP categories, dependency scanning, secrets detection, architecture settings, DevSecOps checks, memory hub paths, reporting, and false positive tracking.

# Output Format

Generated reports include a **YAML frontmatter header** before the report body. This header contains structured metadata (risk level, finding counts, OWASP categories, and field definitions) that enables header-first processing:

- An LLM reads the header and decides whether the document is relevant before loading the body
- The header fields map directly to `docs/memory/INDEX.md` routing rows for token-efficient retrieval
- The same fields become SQL columns when memory-hub SQLite Phase 1 is enabled — no rework needed

See [docs/field-registry.md](docs/field-registry.md) for the full field schema and [docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md) for INDEX.md integration instructions.
